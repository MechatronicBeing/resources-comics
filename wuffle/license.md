**Free License**  
  
Wuffle comics uses **"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)"** or **"NO COPYRIGHT"** policy.  
That simply means that Wuffle comics are in the public domain for **everyone's FREE USE**.  
You can copy, modify, distribute, and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.  
  
Why? As an artist, I love to see my creations spread around. All these copyrights and licenses do nothing but hinder my work from spreading.  
I don't want to spend time worrying about who has or doesn't have permission, and I don't want anyone who likes Wuffle to waste time asking me about what they can or cannot do.  
Time is precious and I think we'd rather spend it on creating more works of art than this permission stuff.  
I'm pretty sure that more people will do something like this in the future, considering that it gives creators more power than publishers. Hopefully Wuffle will go far and will serve as an example that you don't need copyrights to succeed.  
  
For art to become a part of culture, you have to let it go free. Let it be shared and copied. A language dies if nobody speaks it. The same goes with art.  
It dies if nobody shares or talks about it.  
  
So feel free to share or make fan art, fan fiction, or any other derivative of **WUFFLE** with no need to ask my permission or credit me.  
  
But if you want to give credit, please say,  
**Wuffle by Piti Yindee** or **Wuffle created by Piti Yindee**  
  
And if you want to share profits from a derivative work or copy with me, please contact me via e-mail at ... so I can give you an official endorsement.  
  
The endorsement will show that buying your products will also help support me, and by extension support the creation of even more Wuffle comics.  
  
Enjoy the comic everyone!
